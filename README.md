# What-After-School
Analysing after school career options

This analysis gives a clear picture of what all majors are most popular, have high earnings, future scopes. This also emphasized on the gender share for each college major. After knowing the present scenario in various fields, students could choose their path for whatever field their interests collide.

## Motivation

So, it becomes impertive for a student to know about various fields and where that field is heading in future.
